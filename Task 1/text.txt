Instructions:

1. Initially, all the necessary libraries were imported as per need.

2. Data is loaded into a pandas dataframe.

3. As the ID column was unique for every data, it is dropped at the beginning.

4. The type of every columns was observed.

5. Then, all the features (categorical, ordinal and numeric) were visualized.

6. We can observe the unnecessary data, null values in the categorical and ordinal features.

7. Numeric columns are visualized to know if they are normal.

8. For null values in categorical and ordinal features, mode is used.

9. For odd characters in the dataset(Example: '#', '-' in Gender column) replacing it with mode.

7. For null values in numeric features, median is used.

8. For normalization of numeric columns methods like log transformation and min - max scaling is used.

9. For correlation analysis, heatmap is visualized.

10. All the object datatype are converted to integer datatype.

11. The non - normalized columns were dropped from the dataset.

12. Now the dataset was divided into train and test dataset in the ratio 7:3 respectively.

13. Machine Learning models like KNN, Random Forest, SVC, Logistic Regression were imported.

14. The train was fit to the data, and training accuracy was obtained for each model.

15. Testing accuracy was calculated using the testing data.

16. Models' accuracy, F1-score and recall were compared.

17. Best performing model is selected.

18. Lastly the model is saved for further use.
